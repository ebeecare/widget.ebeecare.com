You must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement in order to use our website located at www.eBeeCare.com (the &quot;Site&quot;) and related software and services (collectively, the &quot;Platform&quot;). eBeeCare may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on the Site or by sending out emails to the affected Nurse. Each revised version will state its effective date, which will be on or after the date we post it. If the revised version materially reduces your rights or increases your responsibilities, we may post it in advance of the effective date in order to give you notice. Your continued use of the Platform after the effective date of a revised version of this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of its terms.
